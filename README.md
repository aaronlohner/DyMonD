# DyMonD
DyMonD is a framework that **Dy**namically **Mon**itors an application, **D**iscovers its service components and visualizes them together with some performance metrics in the form of a call graph. It consists of three main components: a sniffer, a controller and a web interface (the web interface is not part of this repository). For more details on this framework such as how to run it and an overview of its architecture, please see the [wiki page](https://github.com/a-a-lohn/DyMonD/wiki).
